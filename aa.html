<p>Let’s take a baby example again to understand the unsupervised learning</p>
<img src="Unsupervised Learning.jpg">
<p>We have shown a group of dogs and cats picture to the baby. Let’s say the baby hasn’t seen dogs and cats earlier. </p>
<p>so the baby doesn’t know what are the feature of a cat and a dog. So he’s not able to categorize the dogs and the cats as supervised learning example. In the supervised learning scenario, the baby knew what are the feature of an apple and what are the features of a banana.Because we showed the pictures earlier. In this case baby doesn’t know anything.</p>
<p>There is no labeling.So baby can’t exactly categorize which one is a cat and which one is a dog. but by looking at the picture the baby can tell 1,3,5 animals in the picture look similar and 2,4 animals in the picture look similar but I don’t know the reason and what they are. Labeling it as a dogs and cats is not possible but still we can find the pattern. So that’s known as unsupervised learning.</p>
